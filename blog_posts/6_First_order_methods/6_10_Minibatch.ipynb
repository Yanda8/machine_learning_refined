In the left panel we show these three histories with respect to the batch-size = $1$ steps, that is we show the cost function value at every single step of the batch-size = $1$ method and plot the histories of our other mini-batch method every $10$ steps and full batch method every $100$ steps for visual comparison.  In the right panel we show all three histories only after each full epoch is complete.  In either case, we can see clearly that both mini-batch approaches descended significantly faster than their full batch version."
