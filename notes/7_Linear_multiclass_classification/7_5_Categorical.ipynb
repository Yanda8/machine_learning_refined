We can use other numerical values if we desire - or even unordered objects like one-hot encoded vectors.  However regardless of how we define our labels we still end up building the same sort multi-class classifier we have seen previously - tuning its weights by minimization of a familiar cost function like e.g., the Multi-class Softmax / Cross Entropy cost."
