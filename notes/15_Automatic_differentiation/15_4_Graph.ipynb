    "Virtually any function $g$ expressed via a formula can be broken down - akin to the way physical substances may be broken down into their atomic parts - into a combination of elementary functions (e.g., $\\text{sin}$, $\\text{log}$, etc.,) and operations (e.g., addition, subtraction, etc.,).  One very useful way of organizing the elementary decomposition of a generic function is via a so-called *computation graph*.  The *computation graph* of a function $g$ not only allows us to more easily understand it as a combination of elementury functions and operations, but it also allows us to evaluate a function in a recursive (and therefore very programmatic) way."

This graphical depiction is like a blueprint, showing us precisely how $g$ is constructed from elementary functions *and* operations.  We read this computation graph *from left to right* starting with the input node representing $w$ and ending with the full computation of $g\\left(w\\right)$ on the right.  Each *node* (after the input on the left, colored yellow) in the graph represents *a single elementary function or operation*, and is marked as such, and the arrows conecting pairs of nodes are called *directed edges* which show how computation flows when computing a value $g(w)$.  The words *parent* and *child* are often used to describe the local topology of a computation graphs, or in other words two nodes connected in a graph by a single edge.  The parent node is the one taking in the other node as input, or where the arrow points to.  The child node is the input of the parent, or where the arrow originates.  Because these terms / relationships are defined locally a particular node can be both a parent and a child with respect to other nodes in the graph. "

    "where the final formula for $e = g(w)$.  Note how each node is a function of its children.  So we can, for example, write $a$ as $a(w)$, since $w$ is the child node of $a$.  Likewise we can write $d$ as $d(a,b)$, since both $a$ and $b$ are children of $d$. However in the end, if we unwravel the definition of each node, every node is really a function of the input $w$ alone.  In other words, we can think of each node as a funciton of $w$ as well so e.g., the $d$ can be written as a function of its children as $d(a,b)$ or as a function of the input $w$ as $d(w)$."

    "In the figure below we illustrate how the value $g\\left(w\\right)$ for the value $w = 1.5$ is computed using the computation graph.  Beginning on the left we first substitute in the value $w=1.5$ in the input node.  We then evaluate each of the $w$ node's parent nodes, here computing $a\\left(1.5\\right) = \\text{tanh}(1.5)$, $b\\left(1.5\\right)=\\text{cos}(1.5)$, and $c\\left(1.5\\right) = \\text{log}(1.5)$, illustrated visually in the left panel with the child node highlighted in blue and the parents in red.  Computation next flows to any parent whose children have all been evaluated, here the node $d$, as illustrated in the middle panel which uses the same coloring to denote the child and parent nodes.  Note how in computing $d\\left(1.5\\right) = a(1.5) \\times b(1.5)$ we only need access to its evaluated children, that is $a\\left(1.5\\right)$ and $b\\left(1.5\\right)$, which we have indeed already computed.  We then evalute the final parent node in the graph - $e$ - at our desired input value.  Once again to compute $e\\left(1.5\\right) = c(1.5) + d(1.5)$ we only need access to the evaluations made at its children, here $c\\left(1.5\\right)$ and $d\\left(1.5\\right)$, which have already been computed.

The two distinct inputs $w_1$ and $w_2$ here are each represented by a distinct node.
